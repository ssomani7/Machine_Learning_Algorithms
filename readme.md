# Machine Learning Algorithms

This project will contain implementation of different machine learning algorithms.

## Logistic Regression

* Analyzing [Titanic Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) to predict a classification of survival or deceased.</br>
* Logistic Regression used for this classification over Linear Regression because linear regression will produce high variance for the binary classification. Thus, making the prediction less accurate.
